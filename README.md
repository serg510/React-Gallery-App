# React-Gallery-App

For this project, I'll use the very popular and in-demand React library to create an image gallery app. I'll be using JSX to write markup-like syntax directly in your JS files and managing state in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components. I'll be working with React supportive tools like the Create React App and React Router modules.

Then I will:

- Use JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.
- Use React Router to set up routes for three default topic pages and a search page.
- Use the Fetch API or a tool like Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API and use it to display images in your app.
- Add logic to handle the search and various requirements of the project.
- Add to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.

              Get Started

step 1:
To install dependencies
npm install

step 2:
create a config.js file in the src folder, add the flickr api key into config.js
const apiKey = '';
export default apiKey;

step 3:
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
